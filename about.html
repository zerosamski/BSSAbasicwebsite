			<h3> 
				Synopsis 
			</h3>
			<p>
				Horizon Zero Dawn takes place a thousand years into the future, in a post-apocalyptic world where colossal machines dominate the land. Over time, human civilization has regressed to tribal societies of hunters and gatherers who survive in immense forests, imposing mountain ranges, and the atmospheric ruins of their ancestors – all while the machines become increasingly powerful. The player controls Aloy, a huntress who uses her speed, cunning, and agility to stay alive and protect her tribe against the force, size, and power of the machines.

			<h3> 
				Environment 
			</h3>
			<p>
				The open world of Horizon Zero Dawn is dense, varied, and full of opportunities for exploration, as well as transitionally dynamic and seamless, due to day-night and weather system cycles, and a lack of loading screens. Guerrilla Games has stated that they are focusing on world density in particular, rather than size. Of the three known biomes—alpine, desert, and tundra—all are said to be explorable. However, the different biomes and wheater condition do not affect the player status. So, for example, cold and warm areas do not require different types of clothing.
