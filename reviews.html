				There’s something about being dropped into a brand new game world and finding it to be dense with deeply considered lore, terrifyingly aggressive creatures, and tantalizing questions that leaves an indelible mark on the memory. Horizon Zero Dawn is one of those games, and it carves out a unique identity within the popular action-roleplaying genre.... <a target=_blank href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review">continue reading</a>

				Guerilla Games has been known solely for Killzone for well over a decade. It’s a series I’ve personally loved since it debuted in 2004, even though it’s been considered by many to be overshadowed by its competitors. For a developer to make a single series for 13 years and still deliver a title such as Horizon Zero Dawn is incredible. Not only is it comfortably the most gorgeous-looking game on PlayStation 4, but it’s also brilliant fun to play – and often verges on masterpiece levels of game design.... <a target=_blank href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/horizon-zero-dawn">continue reading</a>

				For years now, the latest console generation has been coasting on the idea that more raw power means better games. The PS4’s newest exclusive, Horizon Zero Dawn, is the rare game that delivers on that promise. To play Guerilla Games’ Horizon Zero Dawn is to feel awe. Awe over sheer technical wizardry and its ability to transport you into a new world. Awe over discovering gargantuan mechanical dinosaurs and gradually uncovering the mysteries of a lost civilization.... <a target=_blank href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-the-kotaku-review-1792538336">continue reading</a>

				With its incredible-looking environments and an ornate combat system, Horizon: Zero Dawn is an easy game to slip back into (even if you've ignored it for the better part of a year). The Frozen Wilds expansion makes a return visit even more enticing with new gear and challenges to seek out in the frozen north, with fresh enemies balanced to fit into the game's latter half. There's also a new storyline, which slightly expands your knowledge of the past and hints at events to come.... <a target=_blank href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/horizon-zero-dawn-the-frozen-wilds-review/1900-6416802/">continue reading</a>

				It seemed like Guerrilla Games might be trapped churning out Killzone games forever until the surprise announcement of Horizon Zero Dawn at E3 2015. Here was something stunningly different from the moody, dark shooter heritage of this team: a gorgeous, colorful, third-person open-world game that focused on tracking and hunting massive robotic beasts. Could they really do this? The answer is yes. Horizon Zero Dawn is a refreshing change of pace for Guerrilla Games..... <a target=_blank href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/2/20/14576092/horizon-zero-dawn-review-ps4-playstation-4-sony-guerrilla-games">continue reading</a>
